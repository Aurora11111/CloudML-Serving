i tend to think that when the list is longer than the rest of the article , there 's a problem either the history and characteristics should be expanded , of the list should be culled i personally like the consensus that was reached in the tripel article between and others myself included we decided that the country of origin should be highlighted with the most examples there we did trappist , abbey , and foreign foreign includes all non belgium examples this way the article is an article in an encyclopedia , not a list people can find lists anywhere , and the article should reference this also , the style statistics are bad when you say style statistics , it sounds like a prescription , not a description an encyclopedia should follow the latter , and if the former is used , a citation should follow and you 'll not find a valid one for this style in it 's country of origin	0	0	0	0	0	0

czech republic is in central europe the state of this article is part of the reason why people are making such confusions especially more ridiculous is that they you would replace the mention of north caucasus in favor of north slope of caucasus mountains which isnt even a geographical area other than denoting the mountains in that region countries are located within continents , yet for some reason you refuse to allow this article to be denoted a continent this single factor alone would have made a massive difference for readers i'm tired of arguing with people who are essentially wiki squatters refusing to nudge on a given article 24 90 230 216	0	0	0	0	0	0

paleontologists agree that organic remains must be buried quickly so they can be preserved long enough to be come fossilized however , the term fossilized is not a very precise term there are several factors and metamorphic mineral processes which occur to organic remains that result in what is typically called a fossil one major factor concerns what kind of organisms are to be fossilized vertebrate , invertebrates , radiolarians , sponges , plants , pollen , foot prints , etc and multiple processes may include permineralization , recrystalization , carbonization , replacement , dissolving , diagenesis , etc talking about fossilization is a complex issue , however quick burial is not questioned the major question is , how long does it take for these processes to work on organic reamins in the environment they are found in \? experimental taphonomy has resulted in an assortment of remains becoming fossilized by various processes in the lab , which of course implies that given the right conditions , vast ages are not an issue the metamorphic processes are ongoing until an equilibrium is met between the chemical enviroument of the burial site and the minerals of the organic remains flood catastrophic geologists do not expect that organic remains buried during the flood were completely fossilized within the one year period of the flood , but rather that there has been some 4000 years for the processes to have been working much more work needs to be done on the taphonomy of organic remains yet , how one interprets even those results will depend upon which world view you choose to believe with	0	0	0	0	0	0

ahh , hello witzeman 203 92 84 161 symbols m m characters greek cyrillic ipa t d my famous article witze happiness wikipedia the witzeman is a great honour that has been passed down through the generations of many families , regardless of race , age , character or knowledge the outside world knows little about these elusive characters , and the honour of the witzeman for those who have ever been a witzeman , it has been said to have been a great honour , although the qualities needed for the job have never been disclosed a person may not now they were a witzeman for many years , until they are called by former witzemans via dreams associates of the witzeman are known to be a certain babe cool or the much lesser known witzewoman the present witzeman is an 11 year old boy namely benjamin woods , who is said to have become a witzeman after he felt this 'awesome radiance in his top right bumcheek' he has not told a great number of people his testimony , but has promised to do so in years to come history the present world has only come enlightned with the knowledge of the witzeman in present years , because former witzemen have not been so public about the honour , to abide with the formality and conservativism in their time the term 'witzeman' is a compound word of the adjective witze and 'man' , witze being an 11th century term for 'a person of extreme humour and radiant intelligence' unfortuneatly , witze is also sometimes associated with bad wind , for unspeakable reasons proper history as early as the 14th century , witzemen were considered outcasts , and young children were encouraged to poke them with sticks this led to the 1st witzeman rebellion of 1555 when the current witzeman and his followers attempted a coup to take over the local council chess team this rebellion further disgraced the witzeman , as he and his followers were embarassingly pronounced 'gaga' at a government meeting that year the period from here to the early 1900s was a dark time in the witzemans history however good times were to come for the witzeman many normal people took part in mass demonstrations and protests for the witzeman in the 1980s , building up to a great moment in the history the great rebellion of 1988 this was when several witzeman sprinted round the visitors gallery of the house of commons , wearing clown masks , but otherwise completely naked this was thought to be an act of circambulation however many people who witnessed this shocking behaviour , were 'mentally , spiritually , and emotionallly scarred for life' this group of people included many young children who were forced to go to asylums in a state of mental instability , suffering from trauma it was at this time that the government finally took positive action for the witzeman in 1990 , a bill of rights for the witzeman was signed , stating all witzemen were allowed to do as they pleased although this was a formal agreement , many journalists viewed it as a letter of submission from the government to the witzeman , as the behaviour of the witzeman and his followers became more and more twisted	0	0	0	0	0	0

hmm ok so we might be miners digging from opposite sides on this one i think there are two separate points to clarify 1 \) i agree that we have two competing systems of measurement , and i do n't mind them both being on the same page i guess we just have to decide which is the default \( by which a monarch moves or is placed above below a near neighbour \) basically , i feel that if we had two dead monarchs whose reigns were very close to each other , but where the absolute days conflicted with years days , we should have years days override absolute days and perhaps include a footnote to draw attention to the overlap anything else would appear like a mistake i 've just checked , and so far , none of our close ties present too much of a conflict for now 2 \) what to do when bhumibol , elizabeth , and tuanku approach another monarch in table one my feeling is that these problems are unique , momentary events that resolve themselves once a monarch in motion \( alive \) passes a monarch in stasis \( dead ! \) , they move up the list the problem at stake \( and this happens only a few times a year \) is precisely when to move them since they do n't move up automatically \( one of us does it manually \) , we are bound to be inaccurate i'm in the central time zone of north america , so when exactly did bhumibol surpass victoria his time zone , hers , mine and if i change it in the evening versus the morning , what day does that constitute \? to be honest , we usually make changes when we think to check the page and manually move a monarch i'm okay with that	0	0	0	0	0	0

blanking of contributions has to stop there is no , zero , justification for the continual blanking of my edits it is outrageous behavior that needs to cease there were a few stated objections to past edits \( which were overwhelmingly trivial \) that have been noted and taken into account in fact , i am not even reverting i carefully edited the page slowly in order to make sure that there was no problem with the individual facts but the goalposts keep shifting i am in essence being told that simple dislike of my tone is adequate grounds for the mass deletion of everything i do there is no policy to justify this i probably have introduced more sourced material into the article than the vast majority of users , but am nonetheless told i am engaged in original research this comes from someone defending the lie about blix saying it would have just taken a few months to disarm iraq it is indeed a lie because he had a list of unresolved disarmament issues that iraq needed to provide information about these were essentially the same issues that unscom spent over seven years trying to resolve without success on 7 march he said iraq was taking some proactive steps but they did not necessarily cover all areas of relevance hypothetically , they could be resolved in months in the event of proactive cooperation but on 19 march he made clear that our experts have found so far that in substance only limited new information has been provided that will help to resolve remaining questions so how on earth was it going to be resolved in months when , in the last four months , only limited new information had been provided about issues that were supposed to have been resolved within 90 days 12 years ago \? obviously , any solution should involve adding to , not demolishing , my contributions but apparently , some people feel that relevant facts cannot be included under any circumstances	0	0	0	0	0	0

the nomination of the article about the london english riots for deletion is probably the most asinine nomination i have ever encountered in wikipedia it is the lead news story for just about every media outlet in the english speaking world \( and most of the rest of the world \) during the worst rioting , many news organisations have devoted their programming to provide on going coverage of the riots as they take place even new zealand 's media is reporting on the riots , and our media is utter crap \( car crashes , weather , sport and some stupid item about a cute animal in a zoo \) 's initial nomination for deletion was idiotic but , his continued obsession with deleting the article , in the face of overwhelming opposition from the general wikipedia community , clearly constitutes disruptive behaviour and hints at his own mental health issues talk	0	0	0	0	0	0

the reasons i dont contribute to wikipedia anymore reversions like the one you just executed on the psychology template presuppose a knowledge of psychology i must imagine that if you do n't understand why the template is inadequate then you have not the faintest idea of what constitutes pscyhology it is a \) an academic \( taught \) discipline , b \) a research discipline , c \) an applied discipline , d \) a profession , interest group and lobby e \) a property of of social perception or a folk psychology if you like and f \) an aspect of the humanities and the social sciences as well as a peer of psychiatry , social work and in some respects occupational therapy g \) a contested political terrain \( which you would understand if a non amateur had written the articles on critical psychology and cultural historical psychology \) neither the template nor the main article bring out these distinctions instead what you have is a bad summary of a first year textbook of an american perspective on the psychodynamic post skinnerian model of psychology circa 1950s having to explain this and to persuade you is hardly what someone with advanced expertise in the area wants to be doing on a saturday afternoon it is insulting , demoralizing and a waste of time i imagine that the net sum of your expertise can probably be located at the lower end of a \) or e \) in which case you are probably enthuisiastic about your ignorance so thank you for giving me one more reason not to contribute to a phd from yale what absolute horseshit i have one from harvard and another from cambridge and if you have from yale i 'd be curious where you bought it please do i notice you have had lots of these skirmishes wikipedia 41 242 118 144	0	0	0	0	0	0

that 's exactly it , i think it 's a paradigm difference some people see creationism as morally and factually wrong because of their paradigm , and others see it as morally and factually right because of their paradigm and they 're throwing falsifiability and bias and everything else at each other but when it comes down to it , it 's a paradigm difference at the same time , however , one , the other , or something else is factually true and so what science needs to do is keep as broad a paradigm as possible in allowing itself to go through the process of falsification a scientific community that assumes genesis is true will be limited in its ability to falsify itself because it will always say , well we just have n't figuredn out how to justify that assumption yet but we will ! similarly , a scientific community that assumes god does not exist will say the same thing i think what science needs to do is take a position of neutrality regarding the hypotheses of a creator and allow falsification to take its course where this leads me is this the falsifiable assertions of evolution are evolution is false where there are clear and distinct boundaries between kinds , across which macroevolution cannot occur and evolution is false where life , by its very nature , can never arise from non life in my opinion , if the theory is falsified in that way , id becomes the improved theory because it takes all the contemporary evidence that is explained by evolution , and explains abiogenesis and macroevolution making it that new path integral formulation to f ma however , id requires the paradigm shift that there is a creator not trying to convince you just trying to articulate the id pov for page development do you have a corresponding evo pov or a critique of this one \? 20 33 , 20 nov 2004 \( utc \)	0	0	0	0	0	0

whist i do n't like the tone of the above message \( there 's no need to be aggressive \) people for too long have been using historians opinions as the truth do n't forget a historian has a pov as well so i am inclined to think that such a harsh judgement really ought not to be taken so lightly in being added to an encyclopaedic article	0	0	0	0	0	0

wp delrev i am not interested in the fakland island because apparently british editor are bent on telling people lies in regards to islas malvinas and since the topic of the british colony in those argentine islands are a total denial i think we should tell everyone where this colony came from so un can make an informed desition in regards to real facts rather then the manipulation of them i wonder why you fuys keep deleting the british colony from malvinas as if you guys did n't want them there , maybe that is the real goal , to have argentina remove them next war around , the way the british removed the natives from all lands	0	0	0	0	0	0

so a third pornography industry advocate has joined this correspondence , which increases the number of participants but actually decreases its importance in my affairs , as well as the relevance of wikipedia in important matters regarding the health of our society \( it is lamentably our society i only wish i could call it your society \) but i may call wikipedia your propaganda tool , since you are apparently the one who has been granted authority to tolerate certain comments which you interpret as being unbiased and to crassly delete other information which you interpret as being biased if you really want to avoid bias , just casually investigate the history of your pornography supporting friend horrorshow , who , not surprisingly , has been busy editing other articles that clearly promote the pornography industry wikipedia a free speech tool for the people or a propaganda tool for a certain sector of the population which seeks to control people 's opinions on matters that adversely affect their mental health \? quite a question to ponder but my point on bias is that every author is biased just because wikipedia can be edited by supposedly anybody \( in theory it can be , but in reality it is clearly controlled by certain well organized individuals who have made wikipediaing their vocations \) , does not make wikipedia an unbiased source of information the author of this webpage , who clearly has an interest in displaying information that promotes the pornography industry in the united states , is biased his or her comments on lubben 's religious views clearly betray that sentiment , as do the history of his or her activities on wikipedia and you do n't need to tolerate anything from me any longer , because i will stop now or maybe i wo n't , i guess it depends on just how much time i'm willing to waste communicating with you this is becoming dostoevskian , underground man give it a read sometime it might help you veritas , semper but you and i both know where the truth lies in this matter there is no need for an arbitrator , who , again , would be mistakenly be labeled an unbiased third party	0	0	0	0	0	0
