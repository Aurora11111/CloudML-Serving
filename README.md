# Machine-Learning-Solutions

The idea is to solve many real-world problems using Machine Learning. We will use various open dataset available
from kaggle and other sources to solve the needed problem using Tensorflow. This reposiotory will only use tensorflow
or tensorflow related packages for building machine learning models

# Covers:

Tensorflow-Estimators
Tensorboard
Tensorflow Data Pipeline
Tensorflow Serving
Keras
Many More......

# Available Solutions

Iris - Use new tensorflow pipeline to build a model
Mnist - Using Custom Estimator i.e. Keras to build model and serving
